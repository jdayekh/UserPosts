Assessment React Native Solution

React Native test

Thank you for your application for the React Native developer role.		
						
We ask all applicants to complete a proficiency test so we can judge their technical ability in building a React Native application.

Don’t worry if you can’t fully complete it but as we are looking for creativity and technical ability, it would be best to focus on the areas which will show what you can do.

Create a React Native application with a minimum of two screens

Using the API endpoints
GET https://rawnet-react-native-test.glitch.me/posts.json  
GET https://rawnet-react-native-test.glitch.me/users.json 
GET https://rawnet-react-native-test.glitch.me/comments.json 

Screen 1
A screen containing a list of posts (posts.json), each cell displaying the title of the post. Tapping on a cell should take you to Screen 2.

Screen 2
The detail screen for the selected post

●	Back button should take you back to Screen 1
●	Post title
●	Post body
●	Post author (from users.json)
●	Post comments (from comments.json)
